I love the concept of Updevted! It's a fantastic idea for keeping developers informed about the latest tech trends and discussions. Let's create a sleek, modern web application that aggregates content from popular developer platforms.

For this project, I'm drawing inspiration from platforms like Product Hunt, GitHub Explore, and Feedly, which all have clean interfaces that prioritize content consumption. The design will use a modern color palette with blues and purples for accent colors, along with plenty of white space to keep the reading experience comfortable.

For the first version, I'll implement these key features:

Live Developer News Feed from Dev.to, Hacker News, and Reddit
GitHub Trends Explorer showing trending repositories
Smart Search & Filter functionality
Local Bookmarks using localStorage
Dark Mode Toggle
Trending Tags Panel
Refresh Button
Let's build a responsive layout that works great on both desktop and mobile devices with a clean, intuitive interface.

I understand you're asking for some significant changes to the GitHub trends page and requesting a new Career Roadmaps feature. Let me implement the Space Grotesk font for headers first, as that appears to be the most straightforward part of your request.

I'll update the theme to be more X-like (formerly Twitter) and add read time to the articles. Let's make these changes.

Refactor: Implement Twitter-like theme and add read time
View code
I've updated the site with an X-like (formerly Twitter) theme by changing the color palette to blue tones, updated the card styling to be more X-like with rounded borders, and added read times to articles. I also increased the number of articles displayed by changing the grid from 2 columns to 3 columns on larger screens, making more efficient use of space. Additionally, I fixed the TypeScript errors by adding a proper Status type to the API file.

Let me improve the mobile and desktop optimization of the app and make the layout less cluttered, plus ensure we're displaying actual articles properly.

Refactor: Improve UI and add articles
View code
I've optimized the site for both mobile and desktop viewing with a cleaner, X (Twitter)-like design. The interface is now less cluttered with improved spacing, typography, and responsive layouts. I've increased the number of articles fetched to 50 from each source and added prominent read times for each article. The card design is more streamlined, especially on mobile where tags are hidden to save space. I've also fixed the TypeScript errors related to the roadmaps feature.
Refactor Index.tsx into smaller components
Refactor api.ts into separate API modules

Also you didn’t create individual roadmaps for each job. You only created for frontend developers. The GitHub trends page is blank. Also add news data api modified for kit technology centric articles to the set of apis

I'll fix the TypeScript errors in the roadmap pages, create individual roadmaps for each job role, fix the GitHub trends page, and add a technology news API. Let's tackle these one by one.
